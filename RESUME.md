- Outside of Work interests include fitness, nutrition, personal finance,  and cooking.

- Learning and acquiring new skills to broaden/challenge my exisiting knowledge
- Solving problem in a practical manner
- Improving on solutions that already exist and are considered "defacto", sometimes defacto is defacto for a reason

- Great ability to abosorb new skills 
- Have always been able to find a decent practical solution to problems even when I thought it was impossible
